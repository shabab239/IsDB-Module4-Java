1.                 Merge Lineup:
Now you guys are playing a 2v2 fierce pokemon battle. At one point your and your teammate's pokemons have very low hp. So you created a new rule to merge the hp of your and your teammate's pokemons and create a new pokemon lineup. But the opposite team placed a special condition. You and your teammate have to add the hp of your team's pokemons from opposite directions. That is, your first pokemon's hp will be added to your teammate's last pokemon's hp; your second pokemon's hp will be added to your teammate's second last pokemon's hp and so on and so forth. The None elements denote 0 hp. You and your teammate have the same number of pokemons. Implement the scenario using a proper method which takes your and your teammate's pokemon hp as two arrays (as parameters); and returns the resulting arr.

 

Sample Input / Driver Code:

pokemon_1: [4, 5, -1, None, None]

pokemon_2: [2, 27, 7, 12, None]

 

#Function Call:  print(mergeLineup(pokemon_1, pokemon_2))

 

Sample Output:

[4,17,6,27,2]

 

Explanation:

4+None(0) = 4     {pokemon_1[0]+pokemon_2[4]},

5+12 = 17            {pokemon_1[1]+pokemon_2[3]},

-1+7 = 6               {pokemon_1[2]+pokemon_2[2]},

None(0)+27 = 27 {pokemon_1[3]+pokemon_2[1]},

None(0)+2 = 2     {pokemon_1[4]+pokemon_2[0]}
